# AZURE ML MANAGED ONLINE ENDPOINT CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================
# This file defines the configuration for a managed online endpoint
# in Azure Machine Learning. An endpoint is a stable URL that you
# can call to get real-time predictions from your deployed model.
#
# Key Concepts:
# - Endpoint: A persistent HTTPS URL that receives prediction requests
# - Multiple deployments can exist under one endpoint
# - Traffic can be split between different deployments (A/B testing)
# ============================================================

# Schema version for Azure ML endpoint configuration
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineEndpoint.schema.json

# Name of the endpoint
# This will be part of your scoring URI: https://<endpoint-name>.<region>.inference.ml.azure.com/score
name: diabetes-prediction-endpoint

# Description of what this endpoint does
description: Real-time endpoint for diabetes prediction model - predicts diabetes risk based on patient data

# Authentication mode for accessing the endpoint
# Options:
# - "key": Uses API keys for authentication (simpler, good for initial setup)
# - "aml_token": Uses Azure Active Directory tokens (more secure, better for production)
auth_mode: key

# Tags for organization and tracking
tags:
  model_type: "classification"
  use_case: "diabetes_prediction"
  environment: "production"
