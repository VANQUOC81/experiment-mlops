# ============================================================
# GREEN DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================
# This is identical to deployment.yml but with "green" naming
# Used for blue-green deployment strategy
# ============================================================

$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineDeployment.schema.json

# Name of the GREEN deployment
name: diabetes-deploy-green

# Same endpoint as blue
endpoint_name: diabetes-prediction-endpoint

# Model to deploy (can be different version)
# IMPORTANT: Using @latest can cause issues in blue-green!
# Best practice: Pin to specific version for production
# Example: model: azureml:diabetes-model:2
# For learning: @latest is fine, but be aware both deployments
# will use the same version if you redeploy
model: azureml:diabetes-model@latest

# Scoring script for MLflow model inference
code_configuration:
  code: .
  scoring_script: main.py

# Same environment as blue
environment: azureml:AzureML-sklearn-0.24-ubuntu18.04-py37-cpu@latest

# Same compute settings as blue
# IMPORTANT: Must match blue deployment for fair comparison!
# Using same instance type ensures performance testing is accurate
# Using F8s_v2 - larger VM to avoid container crashes per Azure ML documentation
instance_type: STANDARD_E4S_V3

# Same request settings as blue

# Same health probes as blue
